#  Financial Personality Classification (NLP + Deep Learning)

##  Project Description
The **Financial Personality Classification** project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** to identify an individual's **financial personality type** based on their investment habits, preferences, and textual inputs.  
It classifies users as **Safe Investor**, **Balanced Planner**, or **Risk Taker** by analyzing both their written responses and numerical investment data.

This project can be useful for **financial advisors, fintech platforms**, and **banks** to understand user behavior and provide personalized financial recommendations.

##  Objective
To build a hybrid AI model that combines **text data** and **numeric financial features** to predict the type of investor a person is, using advanced **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques.

---

##  How It Works
1. **Data Collection** – User details like age, gender, and investment patterns are collected.  
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Cleaning, tokenization, and sequence padding are applied to textual data.  
3. **Numeric Data Processing** – Features like age, gender, and investment amounts are scaled using StandardScaler.  
4. **Model Building** – A deep learning model combining LSTM (for text) and Dense layers (for numeric data) is trained.  
5. **Prediction** – The trained model predicts financial personality categories.

##  Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Tools:** Google Colab, GitHub  
- **Dataset:** `Finance_Trends.csv`  

---

##  Results
- The model classifies financial personalities into three types:
  - 🟢 **Safe Investor** — Prefers low-risk investments (FDs, gold, savings).  
  - 🟡 **Balanced Planner** — Mixes safe and moderate-risk investments.  
  - 🔴 **Risk Taker** — Invests in high-risk, high-return options (stocks, crypto).

##  Applications
- Personalized financial advice systems.  
- Investment risk profiling tools.  
- Financial literacy and behavior analysis.  
- AI-driven customer segmentation for fintech companies.
